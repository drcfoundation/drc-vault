# DRC Vault Smart contract

DRC Vault is a secure non-custodial decentralized application created specifically for DRC holders. DRC tokens held in the DRC Vault remain completely under the userâ€™s control and ownership, with nobody else able to access the funds.

Additional benefits may be available to the DRC Vault users in the future.

The smart contract provides functions for DRC holders to deposit and withdraw their DRC into the vault.
